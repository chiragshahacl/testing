# ðŸ’» Running locally

## Installation
To install the entire project locally, the easiest way is to run the run script located in the project root directory.
Once the containers are up and running, you can access the monitor system at http://localhost:3000 to get started.

To acomplish this execute the following command:
```bash
./run.sh [--build]
```
The optional --build argument facilitates rebuilding and purging the project before execution.
